    request:
      text: Rep. Williams’ district is home to tremendous energy resources, from Comanche Peak to the Barnett Shale natural gas reserves. Does the Representative know that large players in the nuclear and natural gas industries support carbon fee and dividend legislation to address climate change? This legislative approach to countering climate change provides energy companies a predictable business cost for carbon dioxide pollution rather than constantly changing and unpredictable regulations.

    request:
      text: Climate change is a hazard to people with disabilities, including disabled vets, which Rep. Williams works hard to serve. A report by the EPA noted that the extreme weather events caused by climate change, such as heat waves, flooding, and droughts, make people with disabilities more susceptible to illness and death. They may face additional physical challenges associated with evacuations, and extreme weather can cause power outages that affect electrically powered medical equipment. We ask Rep. Williams to advance legislation to slow climate change and lessen its impacts.
