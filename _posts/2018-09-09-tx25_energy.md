request:
  - text: Rep. Williams’ district is home to tremendous energy resources, from Comanche Peak to the Barnett Shale natural gas reserves. Does the Representative know that large players in the nuclear and natural gas industries support carbon fee and dividend legislation to address climate change? This legislative approach to countering climate change provides energy companies a predictable business cost for carbon dioxide pollution rather than constantly changing and unpredictable regulations.
