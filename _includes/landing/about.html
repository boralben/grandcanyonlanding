                <div class="about-paragraph"><p>Congressional staffers and representatives have told us nothing is more powerful in helping a representative know what their constituents want than written letters and phone calls.</p></div>
                <div class="about-paragraph"><p>Based on this fact, an effort called Project Grand Canyon was born. Just as the Grand Canyon was excavated one water drop at a time, our Members of Congressâ€™ resistance to climate solutions will be worn down by the drip, drip, drip of 100 phone calls per month.</p></div>
                <div class="about-paragraph"><p>Project Grand Canyon is currently operating in Central Texas and South Minnesota.</p></div>
