    We are a group of Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL) volunteers from Central Texas.<br><br>
    CCL is a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots organization focused on national policies to address climate change.<br><br>
    CCL's consistently respectful, nonpartisan approach to climate education is designed to create a broad, sustainable foundation for climate action.

    Each month, hundreds of Central Texas volunteers call their U.S. Congressperson respectfully urging congressional action on climate change.<br><br>
    Together, volunteers form a slow, steady stream of calls, day after day, eroding their Congresspersonâ€™s resistance to climate solutions.

    Each month, you will receive an email with a call-in date and a discussion topic (with plenty of supporting information).<br><br>
    On your scheduled day, you'll call your Congressperson's office and respectfully urge climate action by discussing your topic.

    CCL volunteers in Minnesota (photographed at the U.S. Capitol) have been implementing Project Grand Canyon since Spring of 2017.<br><br>
    Their Member of Congress, Jason Lewis, had been resisting meeting with CCL. After all the calls, the Member invited CCL for an hour long meeting.<br><br>
    In their words, <i>Did we convert him in one meeting? NO. Did we educate him? Absolutely. Our MOC encouraged us to "keep it coming," and our liaison is now in regular contact with him.</i>
